Parallel Derivative Free Moment Optimization

Features:

 - works with MPI and OpenMP, but also in searial mode
 - offers several MCMC implementations (see list of algorithms)
 - offers several reporting tools, but also exports to classic mcmc types to use in R
 - offers a function to compute slices of the objective function in orthogonal directions, see [example](https://github.com/tlamadon/mopt/blob/master/examples/example-slices.r).
